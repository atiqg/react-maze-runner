# react_maze_runner
A simple maze game made with react.js(hooks api purely). It dynamically generates a maze based on user input, then sets few food sprites across the maze and a player in middle. Player needs to eat all the food spwaned on maze in minimum steps possible.

[✔️] Place your player (in the video it's the red one) roughly in the center of the board.       
[✔️] Generate and place 10 Green Sprites randomly on the board (assuming board size is 10x10).      
[✔️] Count the steps it takes for the player to hit all the green sprites on the board.      
[✔️] Important: Do not use jQuery. Its important you ONLY use ReactJS.
