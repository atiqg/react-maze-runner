[ ] Build this game in ReactJS.
[ ] Render the board in number of squares given by the user.
[ ] Place your player (in the video it's the red one) roughly in the center of the board.
[ ] Generate and place 10 Green Sprites randomly on the board (assuming board size is 10x10).
[ ] Count the steps it takes for the player to hit all the green sprites on the board.
[ ] Important: Do not use jQuery. Its important you ONLY use ReactJS.
